# [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_ . If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
</pre>

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

## 풀이

1. pointer를 buy, sell 두 개를 만든다.
2. sell - buy 가 -profit이거나 0이면 pointer를 동시에 한 칸씩 뒤로 밀어준다.
3. +profit이면 sell pointer만 한 칸씩 이동하면서 maxProfit을 찾는다.

```javascript
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let profit = 0;
  let buy = 0;
  let sell = 1;

  while (sell < prices.length) {
    if (prices[sell] < prices[buy]) {
      buy++;
      sell = buy + 1;
    } else {
      profit = Math.max(profit, prices[sell] - prices[buy]);
      sell++;
    }
  }
  return profit;
};
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let profit = 0;
  let low = prices[0];

  for (let price of prices) {
    profit = Math.max(profit, price - low);
    low = Math.min(low, price);
  }

  return profit;
};
```
